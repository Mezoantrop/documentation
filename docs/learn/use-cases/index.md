## Build a Use Case

Welcome to the bonus mission of Discord missions!
Submit a PR to our documentation under this section and provide a potential use case that Centrifuge can tap into, using the following categories:

- **Through the lens of an asset originator**
  - Which markets around the world could benefit most from asset financing through centrifuge?
 Potential market can be 
- **DeFi protocol composability**
  - Centrifuge has started working with MakerDAO and Aave to create instant liquidity for Tinlake pools. What are other great partnership use cases for Centrifuge?
- **Centrifuge Chain (the home for RWA)**
  - Centrifuge Chain is built for RWA origination. Tinlake is a great use case of what can be done with the Centrifuge chain. What are some other cases you can see for the Centrifuge chain?
- **Polkadot**
  - Interoperability is crucial for DeFiâ€™s success. What are some other projects in the Polkadot ecosystem that you think Centrifuge should integrate with?
 I think that Acala network would be great way enchance the capability of the Centrifuge as Acala has access to many type of liquid market as well as bridged BTC through Ren protocol

For any of these categories above ðŸ‘‰ submit a PR to detail how each use case could work. Make sure to think about the entire flow, technology, and size of the potential!
